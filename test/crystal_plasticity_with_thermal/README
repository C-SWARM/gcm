# The test is designed to perform two tests (with thermal and without thermal) that yield same plasticity response.
# Two tests will be executed at a same time and produce files named without_thermal.txt and with_thermal.txt

# how to compile and run
make
./test_crystal_plasticity_with_thermal
diff without_thermal.txt with_thermal.txt
