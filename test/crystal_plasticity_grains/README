# The test example computes crystal plasticity responses: tension, relaxation, and cyclic mode.
# The inputs include crystal orienations (256 grains) and simulation parameters: params_tension.in, params_relaxation.in, params_cyclic.in. 
# Grains are uniformly distributed and responses are computed from each process at a time. 
# At end of simulation, stress strain results are MPI_reduced and printed out with final deformation gradients in the output folder.
#
# How to run:
# compile the test code
make
# run the test

./run_intgration_alg.sh $NP tension
./run_intgration_alg.sh $NP relaxation
